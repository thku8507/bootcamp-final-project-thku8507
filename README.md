 Final project - grassland habitat suitability model
 
Climate change is driving species ranges to shift as plants and animals adapt to a changing landscape of temperature, precipitation and disturbance patterns. Predicting where, when and how habitat ranges allows land managers to proactively manage for vulnerable species and adapt to climate change.  

Sorghastrum nutans, commonly known as indiangrass, is one of the dominant grasses throughout the Great Plainsâ€™ tallgrass prairie (Towne 2002). Growing up to eight feet tall, this species is characteristic of deep-rooted grasses that cover grasslands from the Rocky Mountains to the east coast of the United States. In recent decades S. nutans has shifted its range northward by expanding further into the high and northern plains. As a dominant species, S. nutans may displace other grasses and change grassland ecosystem structure as it expands into new territory. 

To better understand how S. nutans prevalence may change in the century to come, I created a habitat suitability model for two national grasslands near the edge of the current range of S. nutans and predicted changes in habitat suitability based on future climate scenarios. Habitat suitability was estimated with a fuzzy logic model based upon optimal ranges of temperature, precipitation, soil pH, aspect, and slope for S. nutans.

The code for this project is in final-project-thku8507.ipynb. This notebook will run using the earth-analytics-python environment. The user also needs to install scikit-fuzzy using the following code:
conda install -c conda-forge scikit-fuzzy
